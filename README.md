# Power-Apps-Gantt-Chart-Multievents

This is an app template for a gantt chart that supports multipe items per row. Suitable for example resource reservations.

Credit where credit is due: I have built this on top of Terho Antila's Gantt Chart app (https://github.com/TerhoAntila/planner-gantt-chart) and added some modifications by amazing Timo Pertil√§ <3
